## About me

I am a frontend-focused engineer who builds **production-grade interfaces** with a strong emphasis on **architecture, scalability and user experience**.

My work sits at the intersection of **engineering and design**. I care deeply about how products feel, how they evolve over time, and how clean, maintainable systems enable teams to move faster without sacrificing quality.

I currently collaborate with a startup (DataStai), building web and mobile tools for micro-businesses, where I work end-to-end: from UI architecture and component systems to application logic and performance considerations.

I value clarity over complexity, thoughtful abstractions over quick fixes, and products that solve real problems in a simple and elegant way.

## Development philosophy

I approach development with a **product mindset**.

- I prioritize **clear architecture** over premature abstraction  
- I design **reusable, composable components** that scale with the product  
- I focus on **UX details**: spacing, transitions, feedback, and accessibility  
- I aim for a balance between **performance, readability and long-term maintainability**

Every line of code should have a reason to exist.
